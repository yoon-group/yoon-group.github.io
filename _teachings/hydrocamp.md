title: Hydrogeology Field Camp
description: This intensive field- and lab-based course introduces students to groundwater flow, karst hydrogeology, and surface water-groundwater interactions through classroom instruction, laboratory exercises, and multi-day field investigations. Students will collect, analyze, and synthesize hydrogeologic and hydrochemical data into professional technical reports.

## Goals
- Quantitatively interpret groundwater levels and construct potentiometric surface maps.
- Understand well hydraulics and design, execute, and interpret aquifer and well tests.
- Design and conduct dye-tracing and hydrogeochemical field investigations.
- Analyze fluorescence, ion chromatography (IC), gas chromatography (GC), isotopic, and in situ sensor datasets.
- Synthesize multi-source datasets into clear, professional technical reports.

## Format
This course combines classroom lectures, laboratory practice, fieldwork, and technical reporting. The course will meet either on campus (mostly in classrooms and laboratories) or at field sites.  
- **Classroom Lectures** introduce theoretical concepts and field methods.  
- **Laboratory practices** include sampling preparation, calibration, surveying, and data analysis.  
- **Fieldwork** includes four full field days of groundwater, hydrochemical, and tracer investigations.  
- **Reports** integrate daily data and culminate in a final synthesis report. 

## Prerequisites
- None, but background coursework in hydrology or hydrogeology is recommended.

## REQUIRED MATERIALS 
- Field notebook (waterproof recommended) 
- Laptop with QGIS and Excel installed 
- Appropriate field clothing and footwear 
- Refillable water bottle and sun/rain protection 

## Textbooks (optional)
- Goldscheider, N., & Drew, D. (Eds.). (2007). Methods in karst hydrogeology: IAH: International Contributions to Hydrogeology, 26. 

## Grading
- Assignments 1 - 8: 5 points each (40 total) 
- Final Synthesis Report: 40 points
