## How to access the group workstations
Three workstations are available in Quantitative Hydrogeology Lab.

| Name | IP |
| ------------ | ------------ |
|   yoon-group-0   |    10.242.75.188   |
|   yoon-group-1   |    10.227.17.58   |
|   yoon-group-2   |    10.227.17.189    |

<p></p>

The ID, SSH password, and VNC port number will be created and provided to each member upon request to Sean. 

| ID |  VNC port number | accesible workstations | 
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| lindsey     | 2 | yoon-group-2 |
| fabian      | 3 | yoon-group-0,1,2 |
| samuel      | 4 | yoon-group-2 |
| madison     | 5 | yoon-group-0,1,2 |
| keith       | 6 | yoon-group-0,1,2 |

- An example of setting up a GUI connection on the workstation ‘yoon-group-2’ using the credentials of 'lindsey' is shown below. 
- Download and install turboVNC viewer according to the OS of your local machine ([Download turboVNC Viewer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/turbovnc/)).
- For Windows users, PuTTY is required ([Download PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)). For mac OS users, skip to step 2. 
- Always close the VNC server session when you are finished with your work. If you need to run a process in the background for an extended time, use the [screen](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/screen-command-in-linux-with-examples/) command to run it in a screen session.

1. Run PuTTY and enter IP address 10.227.17.189 and a title for your session as shown below. The example below is test; you can have your own title. Click Save to save your settings for future use, and then click Open to initiate your SSH tunnel.

<br>

2. Once a terminal is open, type your id and ssh password as below. (For mac OS, open terminal and login by ‘ssh lindsey@10.227.17.189.)

<br>

3. Change your ssh password as you want for security. To change the password, type ‘passwd’.
<br>

4. Run a VNC server on your assigned port number by ‘vncserver :2’. You will be asked to create your VNC password (8 digits). If you want to change the password later, type in vncpasswd.

<br>

5. open turboVNC viewer in your local machine, type in IP address + port number, click ‘Connect’

<br>

6. type in your VNC passwd (8 digtis).

<br>

7. Once you are connected, you should see the default desktop. It should look something like this:

<br>

8. Again, always close the VNC server session ("vncserver -kill :2") when you are finished with your work. If you need to run a process in the background for an extended time, use the <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/screen-command-in-linux-with-examples/">screen</a> command to run it in a screen session.
