This note outlines the procedure for preparing, curing, and bonding PDMS (Polydimethylsiloxane) to produce PDMS-based microfluidic chips. PDMS is a silicon-based organic polymer commonly used in the fabrication of microfluidic devices due to its flexibility, optical transparency, and biocompatibility. This process should be followed after photomask printing and the fabrication of patterned chips using photoresist. The current procedure is based on existing literature and will be updated as we gain more experience with PDMS chip fabrication.
