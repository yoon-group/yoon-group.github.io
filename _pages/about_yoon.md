<strong>Seonkyoo (Sean) Yoon</strong> (PI):
Sean, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Florida, is a physical hydrologist studying flow and reactive transport phenomena within porous and fractured media. His research approach combines theoretical, computational, experimental, and field-based methods to quantify these phenomena across different scales, from the microscopic to the field level. His current research interests include karst flow and transport, surface water and groundwater interaction, microbial nitrogen processing, and fluid-rock interaction. As a dad to three kids, Sean delights in watching movies, spending time at playgrounds and pools, playing chess, board games, and basketball, with his family.
