Fabian, a PhD student in the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Florida, is a hydrologist studying flow and transport processes across spatiotemporal scales by integrating tracer data and computational modeling. His current research focuses on the interaction between multi-scale porosity systems within karst aquifers, specifically conduit, fracture, and intergranular porosity—collectively known as a triple porosity system. Fabian takes a holistic approach that encompasses theoretical, computational, experimental, and field-based methods. This integrated approach aims not only to expand our understanding of karst water dynamics but also to contribute to the development of strategies that ensure the sustainable coexistence of water resources and ecosystems. Fabian enjoys outdoor activities, such as trekking along rugged trails and sport climbing.
