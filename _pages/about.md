<p>We research fluid flow and reactive transport in geologic systems, focusing on the complex interactions between geologic <strong>structures</strong>, <strong>flow</strong> dynamics, solute <strong>transport</strong>, geochemical <strong>reactions</strong>, and <strong>microbial</strong> processes. Our goal is to deepen our understanding of how these interconnected processes influence the environment, shape ecosystems, and affect water and energy resources.</p>

We operate two laboratories: 
<p><em><u>Geofluids Lab</u></em> focuses on utilizing experimental methods to investigate biogeochemical processes within hydrogeologic systems at the micro-scale. This lab is equipped with instruments for microfluidic experiments and particle image velocimetry, enabling us to directly observe these processes in detail.</p>

<p><em><u>Quantitative Hydrogeology Lab</u></em> leverages high-performance computational modeling and fluorescence spectroscopy to study flow and reactive transport processes across various scales, from the microscopic to the field level. This lab is equipped with high-performance workstations, instruments for fluorescence spectroscopy, and exclusive access to the supercomputing resources at UF HiPerGator.</p>

We operate two laboratories within the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Florida (UF): Geofluids Lab and Quantitative Hydrogeology Lab.

**Geofluids Lab** focuses on utilizing experimental methods to investigate biogeochemical processes within hydrogeologic systems at the micro-scale. This lab is equipped with instruments for microfluidic experiments and particle image velocimetry, enabling us to directly observe these processes in detail.

**Quantitative Hydrogeology Lab** leverages high-performance computational modeling and fluorescence spectroscopy to study flow and reactive transport processes across various scales, from the microscopic to the field level. This lab is equipped with high-performance workstations, instruments for fluorescence spectroscopy, and exclusive access to the supercomputing resources at UF HiPerGator.



Our research is driven by a **commitment to fostering collaboration** across diverse areas of expertise. We actively partner with researchers in microbiology and hydrogeochemistry, through which we pursue innovative and interdisciplinary breakthroughs in hydrogeology.
