<p>We research fluid flow and reactive transport in geologic systems, with an emphasis on the coupled interactions between geologic <strong>structure</strong>, fluid <strong>flow</strong> dynamics, solute <strong>transport</strong>, geochemical <strong>reactions</strong>, and <strong>microbial</strong> processes. Our research aims to advance understanding of how these interconnected processes regulate environment, shape ecosystems, and affect water and energy resources.</p>

Current research topics include:

<ul>
    <li>Biofilm dynamics in porous media</li>
    <li>Surface water and groundwater interactions in karst aquifers</li>
    <li>Hydro-biogeochemical controls on greenhouse gas cycling in carbonate critical zones</li>
    <li>Data assimilation and machine learning applications for hydrogeological characterization</li>
</ul>


These research thems are pursued through two complementary laboratories:

<p><em><u>Geofluids Lab</u></em> focuses on utilizing experimental methods to investigate biogeochemical processes within hydrogeologic systems at the micro-scale. This lab is equipped with instruments for microfluidic experiments and particle image velocimetry, enabling us to directly observe these processes in detail.</p>

<p><em><u>Quantitative Hydrogeology Lab</u></em> leverages high-performance computational modeling and fluorescence spectroscopy to study flow and reactive transport processes across various scales, from the microscopic to the field level. This lab is equipped with high-performance workstations, instruments for fluorescence spectroscopy, and exclusive access to the supercomputing resources at UF HiPerGator.</p>
