<strong>Keith Lawless</strong>:
Keith Lawless is an M.S. student in the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Florida. His research focuses on the hydrogeochemical processes that govern trace-element cycling in karst aquifers, with particular emphasis on how surface water–groundwater interactions influence redox conditions and arsenic mobilization. Keith is interested in the links between hydrologic processes, geochemistry, and water-resource sustainability, and he plans to pursue a career applying hydrogeologic science to support safe and sustainable groundwater management. In his free time, he enjoys fishing, skiing, hiking, camping, golfing, and traveling to new places.
