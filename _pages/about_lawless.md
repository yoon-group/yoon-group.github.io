<strong>Keith Lawless</strong>:
Keith is an MSc student in the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Florida, interested in the interplay between hydrology and the biogeochemical cycling of nitrogen, carbon, and metals. His current research is focused on surface water and groundwater mixing in a karst aquifer sink-rise system. Specifically, he investigates how varying hydrologic regimes influence carbon and nitrogen cycling dynamics, leading to alternating outgassing of methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) to the atmosphere. His work employs both field and laboratory methods to analyze the extent of hydrologic mixing and greenhouse gas fluxes through the hydrogeological and physiochemical properties of the karst system. In his free time Keith enjoys fishing, skiing, hiking, camping, golfing, and traveling to new places.
