<strong>Keith Lawless</strong>:
Keith Lawless is an M.S. student in the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Florida. His research focuses on the hydrogeochemical processes that govern trace-element cycling in karst aquifers, with particular emphasis on how surface water–groundwater interactions influence redox conditions and arsenic mobilization. His current work centers on the Santa Fe River sink–rise system in north Florida, where he investigates how variable hydrologic mixing drives redox gradients that regulate arsenic release and sequestration in carbonate aquifers. Through field-based monitoring and geochemical analyses, he aims to better understand how dynamic karst hydrology shapes water quality and trace-element behavior. More broadly, Keith is interested in the links between hydrologic processes, geochemistry, and water-resource sustainability, and he plans to pursue a career applying hydrogeologic science to support safe and sustainable groundwater management. In his free time, he enjoys fishing, skiing, hiking, camping, golfing, and traveling to new places.
