Bohyun is a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Department of Geological Sciences at the University of Florida. Her research focuses on geochemistry, with an emphasis on fluid–rock interactions in porous media and their implications for environmental processes. She employs controlled laboratory experiments, complemented by field observations, to investigate how surface water–groundwater mixing in karst aquifers regulates redox conditions, with consequences for microbially mediated nutrient cycling and greenhouse gas production. Outside of research, Bohyun enjoys thoughtful conversations, exploring nature, and spending time with her family, especially with her young son.
