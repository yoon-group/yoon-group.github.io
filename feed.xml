As the PI, my primary goal is to cultivate a supportive and inspiring research environment where motivated and talented students and postdocs can conduct impactful research, grow as researchers, and build strong foundations for their careers. I believe this can only be achieved through shared understanding and goals.</p> <p>I acknowledge that our perspectives evolve as we gain experience and knowledge. While rigid structures can hinder innovation, well-defined group dynamics can foster a productive and creative environment. Your input is invaluable in shaping our group’s structure and goals. Please feel free to share your thoughts or questions about this note. I will continue updating this note to incorporate feedback from group members and to reflect my evolving mentoring experiences.</p> <h2 id="research-projects">Research Projects</h2> <p>We will collaboratively develop research projects that align with your interests, career goals, and funding opportunities. I will propose potential research directions, but our goal is to find projects that inspire you and contribute to the group’s overall objectives.</p> <p>Your initiative and ownership are essential for project success. I will provide guidance and support, but you will take the lead in exploring creative solutions and producing high-quality results. While I expect unexpected research directions to emerge, I also emphasize the importance of focused effort and tangible outcomes.</p> <p>I encourage you to propose your own research ideas. If they align with our group’s goals, we can explore potential avenues for support.</p> <h2 id="work-ethics">Work Ethics</h2> <p>I expect all members to be self-motivated, respectful of others, and committed to research integrity. If you are not self-motivated, academic research may not be the right fit for you. High standards and a passion for discovery are fundamental to our work. If you share these values, I am committed to supporting your growth and success. As a group leader, I will foster a supportive atmosphere and lead by example.</p> <p>Academic research requires dedication and a strong work ethic. While I value flexibility, consistent engagement is crucial. I don’t focus on the number of hours you work each week. What matters is that the work is done rigorously and creatively. One of the key advantages of academic research is the flexibility to choose your working hours. Therefore, I don’t mind when you work, but I ask that you try to be in the office or lab for at least half of each working day. This fosters a supportive research environment with me and your lab mates and ensures you are present for seminars and meetings.</p> <p>I believe that a balanced life is essential for productivity, health, and happiness. I encourage all my group members to maintain a balanced lifestyle. As a research mentor, I am always open to hearing your concerns and sharing my experiences to help you maintain your passion and purpose.</p> <h2 id="absences-and-vacations">Absences and Vacations</h2> <p>Occasional absences for personal reasons, such as family events or short trips, are understandable. Please inform me if you’ll be away for more than a day. All group members are entitled to up to three weeks of vacation per year. Please coordinate extended absences with me in advance to avoid conflicts. If you need additional time off, please discuss it with me.</p> <h2 id="individual-meetings">Individual Meetings</h2> <p>We will hold regular weekly one-on-one meetings to discuss your research progress and any concerns. The meeting date and time for each member may change when scheduling conflicts arise.</p> <p>For these meetings, please prepare PowerPoint slides that include graphs, data, and discussion points. Always remember that clarity is more important than presentation quality. Please send the slides by 8:00 AM on the day of our meeting. This allows me to review them beforehand and make our time together more productive.</p> <p>In addition to presenting your results, please include a slide outlining potential next steps. This practice will help you become a more independent researcher, even though we may develop different directions for next steps during our meeting. After our meeting, please summarize the agreed-upon next steps and email them to me by the end of the day. These summaries will ensure we are on the same page and facilitate future discussions.</p> <p>I am available for unscheduled meetings as needed. Feel free to stop by my office to discuss urgent matters between our regular meetings. For non-urgent questions or requests, such as paperwork, please send an email.</p> <h2 id="group-meetings">Group Meetings</h2> <p>We will hold regular bi-weekly group meetings to foster collaboration and knowledge sharing. Attendance is mandatory unless you are absent due to travel. Meeting formats will vary. You will present your research to the group once per semester. Primarily, group meetings will focus on discussing high-impact journal papers or other research articles with significant findings. Papers introducing new theoretical frameworks or providing overviews are less suitable for in-depth discussion.</p> <p>Discussion leadership will rotate among group members. If you are in charge of leading the discussion, prepare a brief (2-3 minute) introduction summarizing the paper. Encourage active participation by highlighting key points, weak points, and potential research directions. All group members should carefully read the selected paper before the meeting.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="Group"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Expectations in Yoon Research Group]]></summary></entry></feed>
